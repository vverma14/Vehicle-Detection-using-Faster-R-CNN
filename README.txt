The following README gives details about the dataset and the files contained in this folder:

1. Dataset
	Dataset can be downloaded from the following weblink:
	http://tcd.miovision.com/static/dataset/MIO-TCD-Localization.tar
	
	Moreover, the pretrained architecture can be downloaded from:
	VGG: https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5

3. Output
	This folder contains the two sub-folders of each respective method implemented:
	a. sample_resnet_results:  Contains 20 sample images that were obtained when ResNet architecture was used.
	b. sample_vgg_results:  Contains 20 sample images that were obtained when VGG architecture was used.

4. Report and PPT
	This folder contains the Report and Presentation of the Project.
	
5. Compiling Instructions
	After downloading and unzipping the dataset make sure to place the dataset inside the src directory. Also create empty folders "model" to store the pretrained model weights and "model_trained" to save the weights of training procedure.
